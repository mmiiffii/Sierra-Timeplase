**Sierra Nevada — Timelapse Archive**

An ongoing, lightweight archive of Sierra Nevada webcam captures.
Frames are gathered every few minutes, sorted by week, cleaned of glitches, and published to a simple website for fast scrolling and playback.

Captures stills from the Pradollano webcam and stores them inside week-numbered folders.

Removes broken, grey, or partially loaded frames to keep timelines smooth.

Generates small JSON manifests so the web viewer can load quickly.

Publishes a lightweight interface that lets you scrub, slide, or autoplay through each week.

Includes a GitHub Action that can generate full timelapse videos (viewer integration coming soon).
