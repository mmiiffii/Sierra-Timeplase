Sierra Timelapse

A quiet little machine watching Sierra Nevada — collecting frames, sorting them into time, and turning them into something you can scroll through like a living photograph.

This repository automatically downloads webcam stills from the Pradollano camera, organizes them into neat weekly folders, cleans out glitched frames, and serves them through a minimal, touch-friendly viewer on GitHub Pages.

Live Viewer

Explore any captured week directly in your browser:

Once the page opens, choose a week from the top menu, then use the slider or play controls to move through the images.
The focus is pure visual flow — no timestamps, no clutter, just the mountain shifting from morning to night.

Timelapse Generation

The project includes a GitHub Action that can build full timelapse videos from the captured images.
It runs behind the scenes for now, publishing results into Releases. A lightweight, on-page timelapse generator is on the roadmap for the viewer.

What This Repository Does

This project captures a single webcam feed at regular intervals, stores everything in structured weekly archives, cleans the data, and exposes it through a simple, elegant UI. It’s both a small archiving tool and a long-form aesthetic experiment — a way of watching weather, light, and time roll across the slopes.

More refinements are coming, including pruning unneeded legacy files and tightening the underlying structure.
